# BombpartyBot
An improved version of my old python bot, now in java, based off msesjrl's python selenium bot

# How to run
If you have java installed you should be able to double-click **Bombparty-bot.jar** and it should run.

You can also open a terminal or cmd in the folder and run:
```
java -jar Bombparty-bot.jar
```

If you dont have java you can get it for free at https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html

# Errors
If you run the bot with the terminal and get chromedriver errors then open your google chrome and check what version (9x.xxx...) you have. Then download that version from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and replace the one in provided in your OS' folder. For example if you have version 92.0.4515.159 you would download the ChromeDriver for version 92.
